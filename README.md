# Motivation
this library is working well in my experience,
They are other wrapper for github api, i dont claim mine is better :)

But i had to implement my own github api wrapper, because it was a core
part of a project. So i had to really understand it, i could not rely
on a 3rd party library. This is why i reimplemented it.

The other libraries seemed good when i looked. be sure to check them out.

# TODO
* make use of the conditional requests, to handle rate limits
