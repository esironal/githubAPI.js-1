* put ```/githubAPI``` in ```/src```
* put the whole express examples in ```examples/express``` and run it there
* there is a weird hardcoded protection for me
  - how to support it without clogging the library code
  - what about an event to check ?

* how to load the githubAPI.js from the browser
